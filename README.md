# video_preview
Objectives
Practice using onmouseover and onmouseout
Practice working from an existing code base
For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download here) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.
